This repository contains all data and code for the paper "Machine Learning-Aided Design and Screening of an Emergent Protein Function in Synthetic Cells" by Shunshi Kohyama, B√©la P. Frohn, Leon Babl and Petra Schwille, published in Nature Communications (doi).
<br/>


## Repository Structure
The repository contains five directories: 
- [Data](https://github.com/BelaFrohn/syninE/Data): Containing all sequences, predicted structures, scores and the model weights. 
- [insilicoScoring](https://github.com/BelaFrohn/syninE/insilicoScoring): The pipeline used to score the generated variants <i>in silico</i>. 
- [PostHocAnalysis](https://github.com/BelaFrohn/syninE/PostHocAnalysis): The jupyter notebook and data used to analyse the <i>in silico</i> scores after unblinding the <i>in vitro</i> results. 
- [ProteinGeneration](https://github.com/BelaFrohn/syninE/ProteinGeneration): The code used to geenrate novel MinE-like sequences. 
- [Analysis](https://github.com/BelaFrohn/syninE/Analysis): The code used to analyse <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> data.
