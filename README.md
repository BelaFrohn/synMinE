The directory ProteinGeneration contains code to train the MSA-VAE and generate novel MinE Homologs. 
The directory insilicoScoring reduces and screens MinE homologs for their predicted function. 
The directory Data contains the raw data generated (model, sequences, structures, etc)
The directory PostHocAnalysis contains the script and data used for post-hoc analyses.
